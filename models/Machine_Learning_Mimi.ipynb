    "Although conservation efforts are always implemented locally, the forces that shape the decision-making process and conservation policy are increasingly global. To simultaneously promote human prosperity while protecting biodiversity requires an understanding of how interactions between local and global forces shape conservation management. Focusing on the mangrove ecosystem, this study concentrates on Sebilang National Park in Indonesia as a pilot site to investigate how global material exchanges may influence ecosystem conservation efforts. Through Random Forest supervised classification identifying land use and land cover change (LULCC) in the park between 2000 and 2017, the study aims to evaluate conservation effectiveness along with increasingly global demands from international trade such as aquaculture, palm oil, and agriculture, which are the main mangrove loss threats in Southeast Asia(reference). The results indicate a 10% increase of mangrove forest due to local mangrove restoration project to transform fish ponds and agriculture lands. However, a booming growth of palm oil has been identified in the park with a surprisingly 390% increase during the period. Our study approves the effectiveness of mangrove conservation efforts in this national park but highlights the potential mangrove deforestation due to palm oil plantation expansion. Although for the moment, palm oil plantation has not replaced mangrove forests, this booming area increase of land use type for the past thirty years, even in the national park, indicates its current popularity in Indonesia for large-scale commodity production under prosperous global demands. This study brings us an awareness to closely monitor and understand the spatial and temporal variation in the mangrove landscape in Indonesia. Future research and policies should address more on monitoring of mangrove deforestation driven by palm oil industries and conserve mangrove forest ecosystems in the area using cutting-edge remote sensing technologies.\n",
